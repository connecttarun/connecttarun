- 👋 Hi, I’m @connecttarun
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things on a broader scale in order to make the best choices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and want to build using java/scala rest-services for the backend, angular/react for UI and some nlp as the driver.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and build better models on kaggle and participate in some competitions 
      as well as build something that runs end to end and is useful.
- 📫 How to reach me ...gettarun20@gmail.com is pretty responsive. I would have written my phone number but I think for global collaboration , 
mails are very eeffective if used properly.

Also not everything here is private, you will see some code, but that is not all of it.
