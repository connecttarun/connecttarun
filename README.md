- 👋 Hi, I’m @connecttarun
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things on a wide scale in order to make the best choices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, angular and some nlp
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and build better models on kaggle and participate in some competitions 
      as well as build something that runs end to end and is useful.
- 📫 How to reach me ...gettarun20@gmail.com is pretty responsive. I would put my phone number but I think for global collaboration , 
mails are quite good if used properly.
