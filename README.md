- 👋 Hi, I’m @connecttarun
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things on a broader scale in order to make the best choices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud and want to build projects that involve an event driven backend using java/scala rest-services.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and build better cloud native applications and participate in events and coding contests as well. 
     
- 📫 How to reach me ...connecttarun20@gmail.com is pretty responsive. I would have written my phone number but I think for global collaboration , 
mails are very effective if used properly.

Also not everything here is public, you will see some code, but that is not all of it.
